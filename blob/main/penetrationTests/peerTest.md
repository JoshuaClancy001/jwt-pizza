**Corrections:** 
Get the price from the database on the server side rather than take it from the request.

# Combined Summary of Learning


- Sanitizing your database inputs is important. 
- Don’t rely on user input for anything but the necessary: 
 - ✅ Username → Yes 
 - ❌ Prices → No 
- Just because no one has hacked it yet doesn’t mean it’s secure.
